## Introduction
This document outlines the transition of our e-commerce platform's state management from the Context API to Redux. The move aims to enhance the performance and maintainability of our global state management.

## User Story
**As a** senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform,  
**I want** my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API,  
**So that** my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state,  
**When** I review the appâ€™s store,  
**Then** I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API.

**When** I review the way the React front end accesses the store,  
**Then** I find that the app uses a Redux provider.

**When** I review the way the app determines changes to its global state,  
**Then** I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API.

**When** I review the way the app extracts state data from the store,  
**Then** I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.

**When** I review the way the app dispatches actions,  
**Then** I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.

## Implementation Details
The implementation involves setting up the Redux store, integrating the Redux provider in the app's main entry file, and refactoring the existing context-based logic to use Redux actions, reducers, and selectors.
